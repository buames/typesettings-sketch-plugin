## Typesettings Sketch Plugin

A quest for consistency

--- 

### Usage

#### `Register Typesettings`

After registering your typesettings, you'll be able to set character spacing and line height for selected text layers or let the plugin do it for you automatically. To register typesettings, you'll want to do the following:

1. Create your text layers
2. Select all text layers
3. Go to `Plugins` / `Typesettings` / `Register Typesettings`

By default, your `<font_family_name>.json` file will save to your `Desktop` but you can change the directory (for instance, to a shared folder) from the plugins preferences.

#### `Set Character Spacing`

Sets the character spacing of any selected text layer based on the font and text size. You can `enable automatic character spacing`—when deselecting text layers—in the plugin preferences.

#### `Set Line Height`

Sets the line height of any selected text layer based on the font and text size. You can `enable automatic line height`—when deselecting text layers—in the plugin preferences.
